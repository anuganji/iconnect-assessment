 Q1
</div>

<pre>
Both jQuery's $.each() and Underscore's _.each() are utility functions used to iterate over collections, such as arrays and objects.

  We should use $.each() when:
    We are already using jQuery in our project.
    We need to iterate over elements in a jQuery object or a DOM NodeList.
    We need to break the loop early by returning false from the callback function.
    We need to modify the original array or object while iterating.

  We should use _.each() when:

    We are already using Underscore in our project.
    We need to iterate over non-jQuery collections, such as plain arrays or objects.
    We need to iterate over a range of numbers using _.times().
    We want to chain the iteration with other Underscore methods, such as _.map() or _.filter().
    We need to provide a context parameter to the callback function to bind this to a specific value.
